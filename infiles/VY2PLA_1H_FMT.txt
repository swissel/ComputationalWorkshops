The files in this directory contain Voyager hourly average plasma data.
The plasma parameters are obtained by finding the best fit of a convected
isotropic Maxwellian distribution to the data. One sigma errors
are typically less than 0.5% in the speed and VR, less than 5% for the
density and thermal speed, and vary greatly for VT and VN.
Sampling times range from 12 to 192 sec., with sampling generally more
frequent early in the mission. The columns are:

1) Year                                         
2) day of year (day 1 is Jan. 1)
3) hour
4) proton speed in km/s (magnitude of V)
5) proton density in cm-3
6) proton thermal speed in km/s (proton temperature in eV = .0052 times the
square of the thermal speed)
7) VR
8) VT (WARNING: this parameter is often NOT reliable after 1989)
9) VN (WARNING: this parameter is often NOT reliable after 1989)

The velocity components are given in the RTN coordinate system,  
where R is radially outward, T is in a plane parallel to the solar
equatorial plane and positive in the direction of solar rotation,
and N completes a right-handed system.

The form of the file name is usually of a form similar to
sc_type_start_end_dis.suff
where any of these may be missing.
sc        is Space Craft v1 or v2
type      is type of data, usually the same as the directory name, (e.g. 
          sedr ha )
start     start time year.day.hour ( day and hour may be missing)
end       end   time year.day.hour ( day and hour may be missing)
dis       descriptor, if any addition processing is needed, (e.g. filt 
          implies the data has been filtered, see README in that 
          directory.)
suff      suffix, Z, gz implies the type of compression etc.

The formats may describe more fields that the data sets contain.
In that case, the fields in the description should just be ignored.
In some cases, 00000 is used as a fill, and implies the that data
is unavailable.  Common sense is required to distinguish missing data
from true zeros.

 
Please consult with us, or at least send preprints, when you use this data to
prevent grievous errors or misconceptions. (John Richardson, jdr@space.mit.edu)
